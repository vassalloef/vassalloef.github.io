        I am interested in the areas of high energy phenomenology, cosmology, and astroparticle physics, which means that I want to understand the evolution of the universe mostly through the interactions of its most fundamental componentsâ€”particles.

        My previous work includes studying dark matter models that could accumulate in the center of the Sun as well as exploring objects called Q-balls which could be at the center of various models of dark matter and baryogenesis.
