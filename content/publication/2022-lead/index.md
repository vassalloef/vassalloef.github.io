abstract: The electron affinities of the primary isotopes of lead have been precisely measured using photodetachment threshold spectroscopy. The relative cross sections for photodetachment from Pb− isotopes 206, 207, and 208 were observed using a tunable midinfrared optical parametric oscillator-amplifier to determine the ground-state binding energies. The isotope-averaged electron affinity of Pb was measured to be 356.723(7) meV, in excellent agreement with previous measurements. Furthermore, the isotope shifts in the electron affinities were determined to be −0.003(4) meV for Pb(206)–Pb(208) and −0.002(4) meV for Pb(207)–Pb(208), providing insight to resolve previous discrepancies regarding the magnitude of these shifts.
