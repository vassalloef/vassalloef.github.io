#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a PhD student from Argentina studying theoretical physics. With experience in experimental and theoretical physics research, my interests are in particle phenomenology beyond the standard model. My latest project focused on studying dark matter models that accumulate in the Sun at significant rates.
